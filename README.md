Mini-torch ðŸ”¥

In this Repository I am trying to build mini-torch which is a Numpy-only implementation of Pytorch.

For now I have started with some of the basic building blocks such as a the Tensor class, MSELoss class and some other Modules. Doing this has helped me understand how these different 
blocks relate to each other and what really goes on under the hood of Pytorch.

At the end of the mini-torch code I have created a small Neural Net which trains on a small dataset. I have also included code for the equivalent model and dataset in Pytorch. The results are approximately equivalent which is great to see.

I hope to add other building blocks into mini-torch as I learn how to use them. 

I recommend anyone else learning ML to do this to get a better grasp of Pytorch, it is especially useful for understanding matrices :)
