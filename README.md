# **Mini-torch 🔥**  

**Mini-torch** is a **NumPy-only** reimplementation of PyTorch, built from scratch to understand what happens *under the hood*.  

Currently, it includes some of the fundamental building blocks, such as:  
- 🧱 **Tensor** class  
- 📉 **MSELoss** class  
- ⚙️ Other essential modules  

Building these from scratch has helped me connect the dots between the core components of PyTorch and appreciate how they work together.  

Also, this library is used for my **Architectures-from-Scratch Reimplementations** https://github.com/RamDwarakanath/Architectures-from-Scratch

## **Demo**
At the end of the `mini-torch` code, you’ll find a **small neural network** that:  
1. Trains on a small dataset using **Mini-torch**  
2. Trains on the same dataset using **PyTorch**  

The results are **approximately equivalent**, which is incredibly satisfying to see!

## **Future Plans**
I plan to continue adding more PyTorch-like building blocks as I learn them.

## **Why I Recommend Doing This**
If you’re learning machine learning, try building your own *mini-torch*.  
- It’s a great way to **understand PyTorch internals**  
- You’ll gain a stronger grasp of **matrix operations** 🧮
